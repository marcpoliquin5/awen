{"$message_type":"diagnostic","message":"type annotations needed","code":{"code":"E0282","explanation":"The compiler could not infer a type and asked for a type annotation.\n\nErroneous code example:\n\n```compile_fail,E0282\nlet x = Vec::new();\n```\n\nThis error indicates that type inference did not result in one unique possible\ntype, and extra information is required. In most cases this can be provided\nby adding a type annotation. Sometimes you need to specify a generic type\nparameter manually.\n\nIn the example above, type `Vec` has a type parameter `T`. When calling\n`Vec::new`, barring any other later usage of the variable `x` that allows the\ncompiler to infer what type `T` is, the compiler needs to be told what it is.\n\nThe type can be specified on the variable:\n\n```\nlet x: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();\n```\n\nThe type can also be specified in the path of the expression:\n\n```\nlet x = Vec::<i32>::new();\n```\n\nIn cases with more complex types, it is not necessary to annotate the full\ntype. Once the ambiguity is resolved, the compiler can infer the rest:\n\n```\nlet x: Vec<_> = \"hello\".chars().rev().collect();\n```\n\nAnother way to provide the compiler with enough information, is to specify the\ngeneric type parameter:\n\n```\nlet x = \"hello\".chars().rev().collect::<Vec<char>>();\n```\n\nAgain, you need not specify the full type if the compiler can infer it:\n\n```\nlet x = \"hello\".chars().rev().collect::<Vec<_>>();\n```\n\nApart from a method or function with a generic type parameter, this error can\noccur when a type parameter of a struct or trait cannot be inferred. In that\ncase it is not always possible to use a type annotation, because all candidates\nhave the same return type. For instance:\n\n```compile_fail,E0282\nstruct Foo<T> {\n    num: T,\n}\n\nimpl<T> Foo<T> {\n    fn bar() -> i32 {\n        0\n    }\n\n    fn baz() {\n        let number = Foo::bar();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis will fail because the compiler does not know which instance of `Foo` to\ncall `bar` on. Change `Foo::bar()` to `Foo::<T>::bar()` to resolve the error.\n"},"level":"error","spans":[{"file_name":"src/storage/export.rs","byte_start":5149,"byte_end":5154,"line_start":145,"line_end":145,"column_start":12,"column_end":17,"is_primary":false,"text":[{"text":"        if entry.file_type().is_file() {","highlight_start":12,"highlight_end":17}],"label":"type must be known at this point","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null},{"file_name":"src/storage/export.rs","byte_start":5122,"byte_end":5127,"line_start":144,"line_end":144,"column_start":13,"column_end":18,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"        let entry = entry?;","highlight_start":13,"highlight_end":18}],"label":null,"suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null}],"children":[{"message":"consider giving `entry` an explicit type","code":null,"level":"help","spans":[{"file_name":"src/storage/export.rs","byte_start":5127,"byte_end":5127,"line_start":144,"line_end":144,"column_start":18,"column_end":18,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"        let entry = entry?;","highlight_start":18,"highlight_end":18}],"label":null,"suggested_replacement":": /* Type */","suggestion_applicability":"HasPlaceholders","expansion":null}],"children":[],"rendered":null}],"rendered":"\u001b[1m\u001b[91merror[E0282]\u001b[0m\u001b[1m: type annotations needed\u001b[0m\n   \u001b[1m\u001b[94m--> \u001b[0msrc/storage/export.rs:144:13\n    \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1m\u001b[94m144\u001b[0m \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m         let entry = entry?;\n    \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m             \u001b[1m\u001b[91m^^^^^\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1m\u001b[94m145\u001b[0m \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m         if entry.file_type().is_file() {\n    \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m            \u001b[1m\u001b[94m-----\u001b[0m \u001b[1m\u001b[94mtype must be known at this point\u001b[0m\n    \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1m\u001b[96mhelp\u001b[0m: consider giving `entry` an explicit type\n    \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1m\u001b[94m144\u001b[0m \u001b[1m\u001b[94m| \u001b[0m        let entry\u001b[92m: /* Type */\u001b[0m = entry?;\n    \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m                  \u001b[92m++++++++++++\u001b[0m\n\n"}
