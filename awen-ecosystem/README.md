AWEN Ecosystem

Plugins, kernel libraries, PDK adapters, and templates live here. This repository provides canonical plugin templates and example kernels to accelerate community contributions.

TODO: Add plugin publishing docs and tests.

 Python integration:
 See `python_awen` for a thin Python wrapper that calls the `awenctl` CLI and returns artifact data for integration with ML toolchains (PyTorch/JAX).

 For more details, refer to the documentation in the `python_awen` repository.
