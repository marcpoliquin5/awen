# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Pinned the Rust toolchain (1.99.1) in `rust-toolchain.toml`, declared and
  CI-checked a minimum supported Rust version of 1.88, added a weekly scheduled
  quality-gate run, Rust build caching, a prebuilt `cargo-audit`, and upgraded
  GitHub Actions off the deprecated Node 20 runtime.
- Added strict normalized equal-batch rank-three StableHLO `dot_general`
  lowering through typed MLIR dialects, deterministic AWENEXE emission, and
  direct Rust runtime preparation.
- Consolidated repository policy, security, CI, licensing, and release evidence.
- Removed obsolete phase sign-offs and nonfunctional product directories.
