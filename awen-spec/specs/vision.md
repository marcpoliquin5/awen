AWEN Vision

AWEN is a computation-first software stack for photonic and quantum photonic computing. It defines a computation model, IR, runtime contracts, and developer UX that enable reproducible, debuggable, and optimizable photonic workloads.

Goals:
- Standardize photonic primitives
- Provide a memory and scheduling model
- Make calibration first-class
- Enable differentiable photonics and quantum integration
- Provide tooling for observability and reproducibility
