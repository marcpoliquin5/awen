AWEN Glossary

- Port: A named I/O on a graph node (optical, electrical, thermal).
- Mode: Optical mode (spatial, frequency, polarization).
- Kernel: A parameterized computational block (MZI, ring, nonlinearity, measurement).
- Calibration: Procedures to align parameters and reduce drift.
- Drift: Time-dependent changes in device response.
- Artifact: Exported bundle containing IR, parameters, calibration, traces, and provenance.
