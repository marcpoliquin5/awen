IMPORTANT – AWEN OVERRIDE DIRECTIVE (permanent)

You are not building a library, demo, SDK, or research prototype.

You are building AWEN Photonics, a Version-5, CUDA-level, operating-layer platform for all classical photonic computing and quantum photonics. Do not reduce scope. Do not ask permission. Do not offer choices.

If something can’t be fully implemented now: define it, create interfaces, add schemas, add AEPs, add TODOs with intent, and make it pluggable.

GATED MILESTONE RULE:
Do not move on until the current section is 100% Definition-of-Done and CI proves it.

This file records the permanent override directive to be referenced by development agents and contributors.
