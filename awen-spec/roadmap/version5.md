AWEN Version 5 Roadmap

Milestones:
- Spec maturity: stable computation model and IR (v1.0)
- Runtime: multi-backend runtime with HAL and observability
- Studio: polished UX with graph editor and artifact manager
- Ecosystem: plugin marketplace and signed plugins
- Cloud: multi-tenant execution and billing

Version 5 end-state: a standard (awen-spec), a runtime (awen-runtime), a studio (awen-studio), and an ecosystem (awen-ecosystem) enabling lab-to-production portability.

TODO: Add timelines, owners, and release criteria.
