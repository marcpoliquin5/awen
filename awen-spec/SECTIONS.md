## AWEN Photonics — PHOTONICS-V5

- Spec file: [awen-spec/PHOTONICS-V5-SPEC.md](awen-spec/PHOTONICS-V5-SPEC.md)
- Purpose: OS-grade, backend-agnostic runtime for classical and quantum photonics. Covers runtime chokepoints, IR, calibration, observability, and conformance rules.
- Required artifacts:
  - Canonical IR schema: [awen-spec/schemas/photonic_ir.v5.json](awen-spec/schemas/photonic_ir.v5.json)
  - Runtime chokepoint interface (to be added under `awen-runtime`)
  - Conformance tests (to be added under `awen-runtime/tests/photonic_conformance`)

Notes:
- This section is the authoritative mapping for the PHOTONICS-V5 spec; each listed item must be implemented or tracked via TODOs in the repository.
